Part 1: Determining Perfect Numbers

/**
 * This program determines and prints all perfect numbers between 1 and 200.
 * A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.
 * For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (excluding itself) are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
 * The program uses nested loops to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 200 and check for perfect numbers.
